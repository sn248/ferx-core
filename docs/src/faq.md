# Frequently Asked Questions

## Do I need to use MU-referencing in my model definitions, like in NONMEM / nlmixr2?

**No.** You do not need to write an explicit `MU_i` intermediate variable — ferx detects the same structure automatically from the right-hand side of each `[individual_parameters]` line.

In NONMEM and nlmixr2, MU-referencing is a convention in which each random effect `ETA(i)` is linearly associated with a single `MU_i` term (typically `MU_i = LOG(THETA(i))`), so individual parameters look like:

```
MU_1 = LOG(THETA(1))
CL   = EXP(MU_1 + ETA(1))
```

This structure is required by NONMEM's SAEM implementation, whose conjugate-Gibbs E-step is only valid when the `MU_i → ETA(i)` relationship is strictly linear (typically on a log scale). Deviating from it — for example writing `CL = THETA(1) * EXP(ETA(1))` without going through an intermediate `MU_1` — causes NONMEM SAEM to reject the model or silently produce biased estimates.

### How ferx handles it

In ferx, you simply write the individual-parameter line in the form that makes sense for your model. The parser inspects each line and records which `THETA` acts as the "anchor" for each `ETA`, then uses that information to re-centre the estimation search at every outer iteration. The following patterns are detected automatically:

```
CL = TVCL * exp(ETA_CL)              # multiplicative exp — most common
CL = exp(log(TVCL) + ETA_CL)         # canonical MU form
CL = TVCL * (WT/70)^0.75 * exp(ETA_CL)   # with covariate adjustment
CL = TVCL + ETA_CL                   # additive eta (linear shift)
```

The parser records `ETA_CL → (TVCL, log_transformed)` and at each outer step computes the shift

```
mu[i] = log(theta[i])   # for multiplicative/exp patterns
mu[i] = theta[i]        # for additive patterns
```

The inner optimizer (and the SAEM exploration-phase MH proposal) is then centred on this `mu` shift rather than on `eta = 0`. This matches the convergence behaviour that NONMEM / nlmixr2 get from an explicit `MU_i = LOG(THETA(i))` block, without requiring you to write it.

Patterns that ferx **does not** auto-detect (and therefore falls back to the plain `eta = 0` start) include:

- Parameters with two or more free thetas in the product (`CL = TVCL * TVSCALE * exp(ETA_CL)`) — ambiguous anchor.
- Compound eta expressions inside the `exp` (`CL = TVCL * exp(ETA_CL + ETA_OCC)`).
- Non-standard transforms the parser doesn't recognise.

Mu-referencing being absent is not an error — it just means that eta for that parameter is initialised to zero at each outer step, same as the pre-automatic behaviour. When a fit runs, ferx records the list of auto-detected mu-referenced ETAs in `FitResult.warnings` (as a line starting with `mu-ref: …`) so you can confirm what the parser picked up.

### Why it matters

Mu-referencing mostly affects convergence speed and robustness, not the final MLE:

- **FOCE / FOCEI**: each outer step re-optimises ETA by BFGS. With a mu-shift, the warm-started BFGS sees a much better starting point when `THETA` moves away from the initial estimate, so fewer inner iterations are needed and pathological steps are less likely.
- **SAEM**: during the exploration phase, Metropolis–Hastings proposals are centred on `mu_k` instead of on the current chain state. This helps the chain escape the (incorrect) `eta = 0` basin when `TVCL` is still far from the true value. During the convergence phase the proposal reverts to a symmetric random walk so that detailed balance holds.

Because the estimator is MLE in both cases, models that converge without mu-referencing will converge to the same estimates with it — just (usually) in fewer iterations.

### Disabling it

If you want to benchmark against the pre-2026 behaviour, set:

```
[fit_options]
  mu_referencing = false
```

or, from the Rust API, `FitOptions { mu_referencing: false, .. }`. The default is `true`.

### Porting from NONMEM

If you have a NONMEM model that uses an explicit `MU_1 = LOG(THETA(1))` line, just drop the `MU_i` intermediate and write the individual parameter directly — ferx will detect the equivalent mu-reference automatically and the fit will be equivalent.

## Can I use `if` / `else` statements like in NONMEM or nlmixr2?

**Yes.** ferx supports two forms of conditional logic in both
`[individual_parameters]` and `[odes]` blocks:

```
# Block form
if (WT > 70) {
  CL = TVCL * (WT / 70)^0.75 * exp(ETA_CL)
} else if (SEX == 1) {
  CL = TVCL * 1.2 * exp(ETA_CL)
} else {
  CL = TVCL * exp(ETA_CL)
}

# Inline (ternary) form
CL = if (SEX == 1) TVCL * 1.5 else TVCL
```

Conditions support comparisons (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`) and
logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`). Either form may be combined with
arbitrary arithmetic, including covariate references and other ETAs.

**Compared to NONMEM:** NONMEM uses Fortran-style `IF (cond) THEN ... ELSE
... ENDIF` and Fortran comparison aliases (`.GT.`, `.LE.`, etc.). ferx uses
C-style braces and operator symbols. The semantics are otherwise the same —
exactly one branch fires per evaluation, the rest are ignored.

**Compared to nlmixr2:** nlmixr2's `if (cond) { ... } else { ... }` syntax
is a near-verbatim match for ferx's block form. Drop the `<-` assignments
in favour of `=` and the model translates directly.

**Caveat:** when a parameter is assigned inside an `if` block, ferx skips
mu-reference detection for that parameter (the `(ETA → THETA)` link is no
longer unconditional). See
[Individual Parameters](model-file/individual-parameters.md#interaction-with-mu-referencing)
for the workaround if you need both conditional logic and mu-referencing
on the same parameter.

**A note on `==` and `!=`:** these operators do an exact bitwise float
comparison. They work as you'd expect for integer-coded covariates
(`SEX == 1`, `STUDY != 3`) but are unreliable on continuous values, where
floating-point round-off can flip the result. For continuous thresholds
prefer a bracketed comparison (`WT >= 70 && WT < 80`) over `WT == 75`.

## Which outer optimizer should I pick?

`bobyqa` (the default) is the right choice for most models —
derivative-free quadratic trust-region, robust to noisy FD gradients, and
consistently reaches a lower OFV than `slsqp` on ODE/PD models, sparse data,
and Hill-ridge identifiability problems. Previously the default was `slsqp`;
the change is one line away if you need the old behaviour
(`optimizer = slsqp` in `[fit_options]`).

Reach for a different optimizer when the default misbehaves:

- **`slsqp`** — gradient-based; faster per iteration on smooth, well-conditioned
  analytical PK models with many parameters. Can stall above the true minimum
  on ill-conditioned fits unless paired with `reconverge_gradient_interval = 1`
  (5–6× cost per gradient).
- **`trust_region`** — second-order Newton trust-region with an AD-based
  gradient and BHHH approximate Hessian. Can be faster near convergence
  because it uses curvature information; the CG budget defaults to
  `ceil(sqrt(n_params))` (~5 for standard NLME models), but you can pin
  it with `steihaug_max_iters` if you have many packed parameters and
  want more aggressive sub-problem solves.
- **`lbfgs` / `bfgs`** — fall back to these only when NLopt is unavailable.

See [Fit Options](model-file/fit-options.md#optimizer-choices) for the full
list.

## How do I fit on the log scale, like NONMEM's `Y = LOG(F) + EPS(1)`?

Use a log-transform-both-sides (LTBS) error model. Two forms are available in the
`[error_model]` block, depending on the scale of your `DV` column:

```
# DV on the natural scale — engine log-transforms DV and the prediction:
log(DV) ~ additive(ADD_LOG)

# DV already log-transformed in the data (e.g. ported from NONMEM):
DV ~ log_additive(ADD_LOG)
```

Both compare `log(prediction)` to a log-scale observation with **additive** error
on the log scale — exactly NONMEM's `IPRED = LOG(F); Y = IPRED + EPS(1)`. Under
LTBS, `IPRED`/`PRED`, `IWRES`/`CWRES`, and simulated `DV` are all reported on the
log scale (back-transform with `exp()` for natural-scale values).

**Relationship to proportional error.** For a small residual CV, additive-on-log
and proportional error coincide. On the warfarin dataset the two
parameterizations agree closely: `examples/warfarin.ferx` (`DV ~
proportional(PROP_ERR)`) fits `PROP_ERR ≈ 0.0106` with `TVCL ≈ 0.133, TVV ≈ 7.69,
TVKA ≈ 0.76`, and `examples/warfarin_ltbs.ferx` (`log(DV) ~ additive(ADD_LOG)`)
fits `ADD_LOG ≈ 0.0106` with `TVCL ≈ 0.133, TVV ≈ 7.74, TVKA ≈ 0.81` — the same
structural parameters and the same residual magnitude. See
[Error Model](model-file/error-model.md#log-transform-both-sides-ltbs) for the
full reference and restrictions.

## How do I scale predictions to match my data's units, like NONMEM's `S1`/`S2`?

Use the `[scaling]` block. The convention is divisive
(`pred_scaled = pred_raw / scale`), matching the natural reading of
`obs_scale = V/1000`.

```
[scaling]
  obs_scale = 1000          # mg/L → mg/mL
```

The block also supports expression-form scales (`obs_scale = WT / 70`)
and an ODE-only Form C that replaces the state readout entirely:

```
[structural_model]
  ode(states=[depot, central])

[scaling]
  y = central / V           # central holds amount; observe as concentration
```

For models with multiple observed compartments (parent + metabolite,
sum-of-moieties, free vs. total), specify a scale per CMT:

```
[scaling]
  obs_scale[CMT=1] = 1000
  obs_scale[CMT=2] = 1
  y[CMT=1] = parent / V
  y[CMT=2] = metab  / VM
```

Every observed CMT must have a matching `[CMT=N]` entry — `fit()`
errors at startup with the list of missing CMTs.

See [Scaling](model-file/scaling.md) for the full reference, including
how this compares to NONMEM's `S1`/`S2` and nlmixr2's `cmt(central); f = ...`.

## My DV data is on the log scale (or I want to fit on the log scale). How do I do that?

Use the log-transform-both-sides (LTBS) error model. There are two forms depending on the scale of the `DV` column:

**`DV` is on the natural (concentration) scale** — use `log(DV) ~ additive(SIGMA)`. ferx log-transforms the `DV` column at load time and compares it to `log(prediction)`:

```
[parameters]
  sigma ADD_LOG ~ 0.1     # additive SD on the log scale (≈ CV if small)

[error_model]
  log(DV) ~ additive(ADD_LOG)
```

**`DV` is already log-transformed in the dataset** — use `DV ~ log_additive(SIGMA)`. ferx takes `DV` as-is and only log-transforms the prediction:

```
[error_model]
  DV ~ log_additive(ADD_LOG)
```

Both produce IPRED, PRED, IWRES, and CWRES on the log scale (back-transform with `exp()` for natural-scale values). BLOQ/M3 is supported; multi-endpoint and SDE models are not. See [Error Model](model-file/error-model.md#log-transform-both-sides-ltbs) for full details.

## Which outer optimizer should I use?

**Default (`bobyqa`)** works well for most models — including ODE/PD models, sparse data, and Hill-ridge problems where gradient-based optimizers stall. If you're unsure, start here.

**`slsqp`** is the right pick when `bobyqa` is too slow on a smooth, well-conditioned model with many parameters (it can take many quadratic-interpolation samples to triangulate a high-dimensional surface). Pair with `reconverge_gradient_interval = 1` if it stalls above an expected OFV.

**`trust_region`** shines on high-parameter-count models (many thetas/omegas) or when combined with `inits_from_nca` — the second-order curvature helps when starting values are good. Set `steihaug_max_iters` if you want to pin the CG budget.

**`gn` / `gn_hybrid`** for fast iteration during model development: Gauss-Newton converges in 10–30 steps vs 100+ for gradient methods. `gn_hybrid` adds a FOCEI polish pass for robustness; that polish stage runs with `bobyqa` by default and inherits any `optimizer` override.

**Gradient-based (`lbfgs`, `mma`)** are rarely needed; prefer `bobyqa` or `slsqp`. See [FOCE/FOCEI — Optimizer Options](estimation/foce.md#optimizer-options) for a full comparison.

## How do I validate a model file without running a full fit?

Use `ferx check`:

```bash
ferx check model.ferx                  # parse + structural validation
ferx check model.ferx --data data.csv  # also run data-dependent checks
ferx check model.ferx --data data.csv --json
```

It runs the parser and every validation step that normally fires at the start
of a fit — missing blocks, missing covariates, per-CMT scaling / error-model
coverage, steady-state and lag-time sanity — then reports the findings and
exits, without fitting. This turns a multi-second fit-to-find-a-typo into a
sub-second loop.

`--json` emits a structured report (stable `code` per finding, optional block /
line / suggestion) that tooling and coding agents can consume directly, rather
than parsing prose. The exit code is `0` when no errors are found, `1` when
there are errors. See the [check report reference](file-formats/check-report.md)
for the JSON schema and the full code table.

## How do I exclude records or subjects, like NONMEM's `$DATA IGNORE=`?

Use the `[data_selection]` block:

```
[data_selection]
  ignore = DV < 0.001          # drop any obs where DV is below detection
  ignore_subjects = [3, 17]    # drop subjects 3 and 17 entirely
```

The `ignore` key works like NONMEM's `$DATA IGNORE=`: a record is excluded when
the expression is true.  The `accept` key is the complement: a record is kept
only when the expression passes (equivalent to NONMEM's `$DATA ACCEPT=`).

| NONMEM | ferx |
|--------|------|
| `$DATA IGNORE=(BW.GT.80)` | `ignore = BW > 80` |
| `$DATA ACCEPT=(DV.GE.0.001)` | `accept = DV >= 0.001` |
| `$DATA IGNORE=(ID.EQ.3) IGNORE=(ID.EQ.17)` | `ignore_subjects = [3, 17]` |

Multiple `ignore` lines mean "exclude if any condition matches"; multiple
`accept` lines mean "exclude unless all conditions pass".  Conditions within a
single line can be joined with `&&` (both must hold to trigger the rule).
`||` within a single expression is not supported — use two separate lines
instead.

After the fit, the CLI prints a `--- Data Selection ---` block and the YAML
output file includes an `exclusions:` section with record counts and the
expressions that fired.  See [Data Selection](model-file/data-selection.md) for
the full reference.
