## Model Description

### Why Use ODEs

Michaelis-Menten (saturable) elimination cannot be described by a simple exponential function. At high concentrations, elimination approaches a maximum rate (VMAX), leading to nonlinear pharmacokinetics. This requires numerical ODE integration.

### ODE System

```
d/dt(depot)   = -KA * depot
d/dt(central) = KA * depot / V - VMAX * central / (KM + central)
```

- **depot**: Absorption compartment. First-order absorption at rate KA.
- **central**: Central compartment. Drug enters from depot and is eliminated by Michaelis-Menten kinetics.

### Parameters

- **VMAX**: Maximum elimination rate (amount/time)
- **KM**: Michaelis-Menten constant (concentration at half-maximal rate)
- **V**: Volume of distribution
- **KA**: First-order absorption rate constant

Note that only VMAX and V have random effects. KM and KA are treated as population parameters (no between-subject variability).

### Structural Model Declaration

```
[structural_model]
  ode(obs_cmt=central, states=[depot, central])
```

- `obs_cmt=central`: The `central` compartment is observed (matched to DV in the data)
- `states=[depot, central]`: Two state variables (compartments)

## Running

```bash
ferx examples/mm_oral.ferx --data data/mm_oral.csv
```

## Notes

- ODE models are slower than analytical models because each prediction requires numerical integration
- The ODE solver uses adaptive step-size control (Dormand-Prince RK45) for accuracy
- For standard first-order kinetics, use the analytical `one_cpt_oral` model instead -- it is much faster
- The `central` compartment in this model contains the drug amount. If you want concentration as the observed variable, divide by V in the ODE equations (as done here with `KA * depot / V`)
