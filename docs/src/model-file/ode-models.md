# ODE Models

For pharmacokinetic models without analytical solutions (e.g., saturable elimination, target-mediated drug disposition), ferx-core provides an ODE solver.

## Structural Model Declaration

```
[structural_model]
  ode(obs_cmt=OBSERVABLE_COMPARTMENT, states=[state1, state2, ...])
```

- **obs_cmt**: The compartment whose concentration is observed (matched to DV)
- **states**: List of state variable names (compartments)

## ODE Equations

The `[odes]` block defines the right-hand side of the ODE system:

```
[odes]
  d/dt(state_name) = expression
```

Expressions can reference:
- State variables by name
- Individual parameters defined in `[individual_parameters]`
- Arithmetic operators and functions (`exp`, `log`, `sqrt`, etc.)
- Conditional logic with the same `if (cond) { ... } else { ... }` and inline
  `if (cond) expr else expr` syntax described in
  [Individual Parameters](individual-parameters.md). For example, you can
  switch between linear and saturable elimination based on the central
  amount:

  ```
  [odes]
    d/dt(depot)   = -KA * depot
    if (central > KM_THRESHOLD) {
      d/dt(central) = KA * depot - VMAX * central / (KM + central)
    } else {
      d/dt(central) = KA * depot - CL_LIN * central
    }
  ```

  Each `d/dt(state)` reachable from any branch counts as defined; states
  that aren't assigned in the firing branch this step receive a derivative
  of `0`.

## Initial Compartment Amounts

By default every compartment starts at zero, and drug enters only through dose
records. To start a compartment at a non-zero amount — e.g. a pre-dose baseline
for an indirect-response / turnover model — declare an initial condition in the
`[odes]` block:

```
[odes]
  init(state_name) = expression
  d/dt(state_name) = expression
```

- The right-hand side is evaluated **once per subject** at the start of the
  record and may reference individual parameters (and therefore folds in
  `theta`, `eta`, and covariates through the `[individual_parameters]` layer).
  State names referenced in an `init` expression are treated as `0` (no drug
  is present yet).
- Compartments without an `init(...)` line start at zero, as before.
- This is the analogue of NONMEM's `A_0(n)`.

**Time-varying covariates.** Because the initial condition is a pre-record
baseline, it is evaluated a single time using the covariate values from the
subject's **first record**. If a covariate that feeds the `init` expression
changes later in the record, the initial amount is *not* re-evaluated — the
later covariate values affect `d/dt(...)` going forward (the system evolves
from the baseline), but the t=0 starting point is fixed by the first record's
covariates. For most models this is exactly what you want, since the baseline
represents the pre-dose steady state. If you need the starting amount to track
a covariate value observed mid-record, model it as a state driven by `d/dt`
rather than as an `init`.

A turnover model whose response variable sits at its baseline `KIN/KOUT`
before any perturbation:

```
[odes]
  init(response) = KIN / KOUT
  d/dt(response) = KIN - KOUT * response
```

**Interaction with system resets (EVID=3/4):** a reset re-applies the `init`
expression to initialized compartments (returning them to baseline) and zeros
all other compartments — so a reset behaves like the start of a fresh episode.
See [Data Format](../data-format.md) for reset rows.

Note one deliberate asymmetry with the start-of-record seeding described above:
the re-applied baseline at a reset is evaluated with the covariate values in
effect **at the reset time**, not the first record's. With time-varying
covariates this means the post-reset baseline reflects the most recent
covariate values — appropriate for a "fresh episode" that starts under current
conditions — whereas the very first baseline uses the first record's
covariates. For time-constant covariates the two are identical.

## Example: Michaelis-Menten Elimination

A one-compartment oral model with saturable (Michaelis-Menten) elimination:

```
[parameters]
  theta TVVMAX(10.0, 0.1, 1000.0)
  theta TVKM(2.0, 0.01, 100.0)
  theta TVV(10.0, 0.1, 500.0)
  theta TVKA(1.0, 0.01, 50.0)

  omega ETA_VMAX ~ 0.09
  omega ETA_V    ~ 0.04

  sigma PROP_ERR ~ 0.1

[individual_parameters]
  VMAX = TVVMAX * exp(ETA_VMAX)
  KM   = TVKM
  V    = TVV * exp(ETA_V)
  KA   = TVKA

[structural_model]
  ode(obs_cmt=central, states=[depot, central])

[odes]
  d/dt(depot)   = -KA * depot
  d/dt(central) = KA * depot / V - VMAX * central / (KM + central)

[error_model]
  DV ~ proportional(PROP_ERR)
```

## Solver Details

ferx-core uses a Dormand-Prince RK45 adaptive solver:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Method | Explicit Runge-Kutta 4(5) |
| Absolute tolerance | 1e-6 |
| Relative tolerance | 1e-4 |
| Max steps | 10,000 |
| Initial step size | 0.1 |
| Minimum step size | 1e-12 |

The solver automatically adapts step sizes based on local error estimates.

## Dose Handling

- **Bolus doses**: Applied as instantaneous state changes at dose times. The dose amount, scaled by bioavailability (`F · AMT`), is added to the target compartment (the state at `CMT − 1`, since `CMT` is 1-based — see indexing below)
- **Infusion doses** (`RATE > 0`): Treated as a continuous zero-order input. The integrator's timeline is broken at the infusion's end (`time + amt/rate`), and `F · RATE` is added to the target compartment's derivative for every segment fully spanned by the infusion. Overlapping infusions on the same compartment sum their rates
- **Compartment indexing**: Compartments are 1-indexed in the data file (`CMT=1` corresponds to the first state in the `states` list)
- **Multiple doses**: The ODE is integrated in segments between dose events, with state discontinuities at each bolus

### Bioavailability

If your `[individual_parameters]` block declares an `F` parameter, the ODE engine
applies it **when the dose enters the compartment** — the dosing compartment is
loaded with `F · AMT` (and an infusion rate with `F · RATE`) — exactly like
NONMEM's `F1` and like ferx's analytical PK functions. Write the depot's
elimination as the plain `KA · depot` and **do not** multiply by `F` anywhere in
the right-hand side, or bioavailability is applied twice. `F` defaults to `1.0`
when not declared, so IV and non-bioavailability models are unaffected.

```text
[individual_parameters]
  CL = TVCL * exp(ETA_CL)
  V  = TVV
  KA = TVKA
  F  = inv_logit(logit(THETA_F) + ETA_F)   # F is applied at dose entry

[odes]
  d/dt(depot)   = -KA * depot
  d/dt(central) =  KA * depot / V - CL/V * central   # no F here
```

> ⚠️ **Migration note.** Earlier versions of ferx added the *full* dose to the
> compartment and required `F` to be folded into the absorption flux (e.g.
> `d/dt(central) = F * KA * depot / V - …`). That `F` must now be removed from
> the right-hand side — otherwise it is applied both at dose entry **and** in the
> flux, giving an effective bioavailability of `F²`.

The name `F` (any case) is what flags a parameter as bioavailability and routes
it to the dosing compartment. If you need a fraction-like quantity inside the
RHS that is *not* bioavailability, give it a different name.

See `examples/bioavailability_ode.ferx` for a complete worked model.

## Stochastic ODE Models (SDE)

To model within-subject system noise that accumulates between observations, add
a `[diffusion]` block to your ODE model.  See [Stochastic Differential
Equations](diffusion.md) for a full description, worked example, and comparison
with sigma and omega.

## Limitations

- The observable compartment contains the amount (not concentration). Divide by volume in the ODE equations if needed
- SDE (`[diffusion]`) is not compatible with SAEM or the autodiff gradient path

Steady-state (`SS=1`) is supported for ODE models via numerical
pulse-expansion equilibration — see [Steady-State Doses](steady-state.md)
for the mechanism and how it differs from the analytical closed forms.
