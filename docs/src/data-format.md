# Data Format

FeRx reads data in NONMEM-compatible CSV format. This is the standard format used across population PK tools.

## Required Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `ID` | string/numeric | Subject identifier |
| `TIME` | numeric | Time relative to first dose |
| `DV` | numeric | Dependent variable (observed concentration) |

## Optional Standard Columns

| Column | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `EVID` | integer | 0 | Event ID: 0 = observation, 1 = dose, 4 = reset + dose |
| `AMT` | numeric | 0 | Dose amount (only for `EVID=1` or `EVID=4`) |
| `CMT` | integer | 1 | Compartment number (1-indexed) |
| `RATE` | numeric | 0 | Infusion rate. 0 = bolus dose |
| `MDV` | integer | 0 | Missing DV flag. 1 = DV should be ignored |
| `II` | numeric | 0 | Interdose interval for repeated dosing |
| `SS` | integer | 0 | Steady-state flag. 1 = assume steady state |
| `CENS` | integer | 0 | Censoring flag. 1 = observation is below LLOQ; `DV` carries the LLOQ value. Paired with `bloq_method = m3` in `[fit_options]` to enable likelihood-based handling — see [BLOQ example](examples/bloq.md). |

## Occasion Column (IOV)

When using Inter-Occasion Variability (IOV), add an occasion-index column to the dataset and specify its name with `iov_column` in `[fit_options]`. The column:

- Contains **integer occasion indices** (e.g. 1, 2, 3…) — one per row
- Applies to both dose rows and observation rows
- Is **excluded from covariate auto-detection**

Example dataset with `OCC` column:

```csv
ID,TIME,DV,EVID,AMT,CMT,MDV,OCC
1,0,.,1,100,1,1,1
1,1,9.5,0,.,.,0,1
1,2,7.3,0,.,.,0,1
1,24,.,1,100,1,1,2
1,25,10.1,0,.,.,0,2
1,26,8.2,0,.,.,0,2
```

The occasion index can be any positive integer; they do not need to start at 1 or be consecutive, but a different number means a different occasion with its own kappa EBE.

See [IOV documentation](estimation/iov.md) for full details.

## Covariate Columns

Any column not in the standard set above is automatically treated as a covariate. Covariate values are:

- **Time-constant**: The first non-missing value for each subject is used
- **Time-varying**: If values change over time for a subject, Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) is applied per event (NONMEM-equivalent: `[individual_parameters]` is re-evaluated at each dose and observation row using that row's covariate values)

Covariate names in the data file are matched case-insensitively to names used in `[individual_parameters]` expressions.

### Time-varying covariate scope

Time-varying covariates are supported for these structural models:

- 1-compartment IV bolus (`one_cpt_iv_bolus`)
- 1-compartment infusion (`one_cpt_infusion`)
- 2-compartment IV bolus (`two_cpt_iv_bolus`)
- 2-compartment infusion (`two_cpt_infusion`)
- All ODE-defined models (via `[odes]`)

Oral models (`*_oral`) and 3-compartment models silently fall back to a single covariate snapshot taken from the first row of each subject — TV-cov support for those is tracked as a follow-up.

When a subject has time-varying covariates and the structural model is in the supported list above, the autodiff (Enzyme) gradient fast path uses an *event-driven* AD kernel that consumes per-event covariate snapshots — gradients stay AD-accelerated. For unsupported models (oral, 3-cpt) the AD path is downgraded to finite-differences for the affected subjects and a warning is surfaced in the fit output. The H-matrix Jacobian (used once per inner-loop iteration) currently uses FD on TV-cov subjects regardless of model — forward-mode AD on the event-driven kernel is a follow-up.

## Event Types (EVID)

| EVID | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Observation record. `DV` is used for estimation. |
| 1 | Dosing record. `AMT` is administered to compartment `CMT`. |
| 4 | Reset and dose. All compartment amounts are reset to zero before dosing. |

## Example Dataset

```csv
ID,TIME,DV,EVID,AMT,CMT,RATE,MDV,WT,CRCL
1,0,.,1,100,1,0,1,70,95
1,0.5,9.49,0,.,.,.,0,70,95
1,1,14.42,0,.,.,.,0,70,95
1,2,17.56,0,.,.,.,0,70,95
1,4,15.23,0,.,.,.,0,70,95
1,8,10.15,0,.,.,.,0,70,95
2,0,.,1,150,1,0,1,85,110
2,0.5,14.2,0,.,.,.,0,85,110
2,1,21.3,0,.,.,.,0,85,110
```

Key points:
- Dose records (`EVID=1`) have `MDV=1` and `DV=.` (missing)
- Observation records (`EVID=0`) have `MDV=0` and a valid `DV`
- Covariates (`WT`, `CRCL`) are included as extra columns
- Missing values can be represented as `.` or left empty

## Infusion Doses

For IV infusions, set `RATE` to the infusion rate (amount per time unit):

```csv
ID,TIME,DV,EVID,AMT,CMT,RATE,MDV
1,0,.,1,500,1,50,1
```

This administers 500 units at a rate of 50 units/hour (duration = 10 hours).

## Steady-State Dosing

For steady-state simulations, set `SS=1` and `II` to the dosing interval:

```csv
ID,TIME,DV,EVID,AMT,CMT,SS,II,MDV
1,0,.,1,100,1,1,12,1
1,0.5,25.3,0,.,.,.,.,0
```

This assumes the subject has reached steady state with 100 units every 12 hours before the observation at TIME=0.5.

## Multiple Doses

Multiple doses are supported as separate rows:

```csv
ID,TIME,DV,EVID,AMT,CMT,MDV
1,0,.,1,100,1,1
1,0.5,9.49,0,.,.,0
1,12,.,1,100,1,1
1,12.5,15.2,0,.,.,0
1,24,.,1,100,1,1
1,24.5,18.1,0,.,.,0
```

## Column Name Case

Column names are case-insensitive. `ID`, `Id`, and `id` are all recognized. Covariate columns preserve their case as declared in the CSV header.
