# Output Files

Each model run produces three output files (plus a fourth, `{model}-covtab.csv`,
when the model declares a [`[covariates]`](model-file/covariates.md) block).

## Quick reference: where to find what

Different quantities live in different outputs — this table is the fastest way to find what you need.

| What you want | Where it lives | Shape | When present |
|---------------|---------------|-------|--------------|
| Covariates in sdtab (via [`[output]`](model-file/output.md)) | `{model}-sdtab.csv` | one row per **observation** | declared in `[output]` |
| Raw covariate values for all dataset records | `{model}-covtab.csv` | one row per **dataset record** (doses + obs) | model has `[covariates]` block |
| ETA / EBE values per subject | `ebes.csv` inside `.fitrx` | one row per **subject** | always |
| `[derived]` computed columns | `{model}-sdtab.csv` | one row per **observation** | model has `[derived]` block |
| `[output]` declared columns (covariates, individual PK parameters) | `{model}-sdtab.csv` | one row per **observation** | declared in `[output]` |

**Key distinctions:**

- `[output]` covariates in the sdtab use LOCF — each observation row carries the covariate value that was active at that time. The covtab carries the covariate exactly as read from each row of the input dataset, including dose and event rows where sdtab has no entry.
- ETA / EBE values are **not** written to sdtab. They live in `fit$ebe_etas` (and `ebes.csv` in the `.fitrx` bundle) — one row per subject. ETAs are available as context variables in `[derived]` expressions (e.g. `KE = CL / V` can reference `ETA_CL`), but are not columns in the sdtab itself.

## sdtab CSV (`{model}-sdtab.csv`)

A CSV file with per-observation diagnostics, one row per observation per subject.

### Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ID` | Subject identifier |
| `TIME` | Observation time |
| `DV` | Observed value |
| `CENS` | Censoring flag (0/1); omitted when no censored observations |
| `OCC` | Occasion label; omitted when model has no IOV block |
| `CMT` | Observation compartment; omitted for single-compartment models |
| `PRED` | Population prediction (eta = 0) |
| `IPRED` | Individual prediction (eta = EBE) |
| `CWRES` | Conditional weighted residual |
| `IWRES` | Individual weighted residual |
| `EBE_OFV` | Each subject's contribution to the total OFV |
| `N_OBS` | Number of observations for the subject |
| `TAFD` | Time after first dose |
| `TAD` | Time after most recent dose (SS-aware) |
| *`[derived]` names* | One column per expression in the `[derived]` block |
| *`[output]` names* | Covariates and individual parameters declared in `[output]` |

### Residual Definitions

**IWRES** (Individual Weighted Residual):
<div>
\[ \text{IWRES}_j = \frac{y_j - \text{IPRED}_j}{\sqrt{V_j}} \]
</div>
where \\( V_j \\) is the residual variance evaluated at the individual prediction.

**CWRES** (Conditional Weighted Residual):
<div>
\[ \text{CWRES}_j = \frac{y_j - f_{0,j}}{\sqrt{\tilde{R}_{jj}}} \]
</div>
where \\( f_0 = f(\hat{\eta}) - H\hat{\eta} \\) is the linearized population prediction and \\( \tilde{R} = H\Omega H^T + R \\) is the conditional variance.

### Example

```csv
ID,TIME,DV,PRED,IPRED,CWRES,IWRES,EBE_OFV,N_OBS,TAFD,TAD
1,0.5,9.49,10.12,9.55,-0.23,-0.06,2.14,8,0.5,0.5
1,1.0,14.42,14.87,14.35,0.18,0.05,2.14,8,1.0,1.0
```

## covtab CSV (`{model}-covtab.csv`)

Written only when the model declares a [`[covariates]`](model-file/covariates.md)
block. Unlike sdtab (observation rows only), it echoes the declared covariate
columns with **one row per input dataset record**, including dose and other-event
rows. Missing values are written as empty cells. It is also available
programmatically as `FitResult::covariate_table`.

### Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ID` | Subject identifier |
| `TIME` | Record time |
| `EVID` | Event ID of the source row (0=obs, 1=dose, 2=other, 3=reset, 4=reset+dose) |
| *declared covariates* | One column per covariate in the `[covariates]` block, in declaration order |

### Example

```csv
ID,TIME,EVID,WT,CRCL
1,0.000000,1,70.600000,73.700000
1,0.500000,0,70.600000,73.700000
1,1.000000,0,70.600000,73.700000
```

A YAML file containing parameter estimates, standard errors, and model diagnostics.

```

The `covariance_matrix:` block is only present when the covariance step ran
successfully or was regularised. The values are in **optimizer space** — thetas
and sigma are on the log scale (or identity scale when the lower bound is
negative), omega and kappa are Cholesky-factored. The `parameters:` list gives
the canonical column order; `rows:` keys match that order. Omega and kappa
diagonal entries appear as `log_chol_<eta>` — the packed value is `log(L_ii)`
where `omega = L Lᵀ` (log of the Cholesky diagonal, **not** the variance).
Off-diagonal Cholesky entries appear as `chol_<eta_row>_<eta_col>` (`L_ij`,
not log-transformed).

### Key Fields

- **ofv**: Objective Function Value (-2 log-likelihood)
- **aic**: Akaike Information Criterion (OFV + 2p)
- **bic**: Bayesian Information Criterion (OFV + p * ln(n))
- **se**: Standard error from the covariance step
- **rse_pct**: Relative standard error as percentage (SE/estimate * 100)
- **cv_pct**: Coefficient of variation for omega (sqrt(variance) * 100)

## FitResult Fields (Rust API / console)

The following fields are populated on the `FitResult` struct returned by `fit()` and printed by `print_results()`. They are **not** currently written to the fit YAML — read them programmatically or from the console summary.

### Shrinkage

Two shrinkage metrics are reported after every fit:

**ETA shrinkage** (per random effect — `shrinkage_eta: Vec<f64>`):
<div>
\[ \text{shrinkage}_k = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_i \hat{\eta}_{k,i}^2}}{\sqrt{\omega_{kk}}} \]
</div>

A value near 1 means individual EBEs are all pulled toward zero — the data are not informative about that random effect. A value near 0 means the ETAs are spread consistent with the prior omega.

**EPS shrinkage** (scalar — `shrinkage_eps: f64`):
<div>
\[ \text{shrinkage}_\varepsilon = 1 - \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_j \text{IWRES}_j^2} \]
</div>

Both formulas use the **uncentered second moment with `n` divisor**, matching the NONMEM / PsN / Monolix convention — the population model assumes `E[η]=0` and `E[IWRES²]=1`, so the natural estimator is `√(Σx²/n)` rather than the unbiased sample SD (which centers on the sample mean and divides by `n-1`). The unbiased form would inflate SD by `√(n/(n-1))` and routinely produce spurious negative shrinkage on small samples.

**Negative `shrinkage_eps`** is mathematically possible and meaningful: it indicates `mean(IWRES²) > 1`, i.e. the residual error model does not absorb the residuals seen at the final EBE etas. Common causes include SAEM converging to a local optimum with under-fit sigma (often resolved by polishing with `method = [saem, focei]` or trying a different start), model misspecification for a subset of subjects (check the IWRES distribution in the sdtab for outliers), or sigma at a bound. When `shrinkage_eps < -5%`, ferx emits a warning to `FitResult.warnings`; the raw value is retained for parity with NONMEM/PsN.

Values of `NaN` indicate a zero-variance omega component (ETA) or fewer than two valid residuals (EPS).

**Kappa shrinkage** (IOV models only — `shrinkage_kappa: Vec<f64>` and `shrinkage_kappa_by_occ: Vec<Vec<f64>>`):

When the model contains `kappa` or `block_kappa` declarations, two additional shrinkage metrics are computed using the same uncentered-moment convention.

*Pooled* — one value per kappa parameter `j`, averaged over all `N_\text{pairs}` (subject, occasion) pairs:
<div>
\[ \text{shrinkage}_{\kappa,j} = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{\frac{1}{N_{\text{pairs}}}\sum_i \sum_{q} \hat{\kappa}_{iqj}^2}}{\sqrt{\omega_{\text{iov},jj}}} \]
</div>
where `q` indexes occasions and `N_\text{pairs} = \sum_i K_i` (total subject-occasion pairs; equals `N_\text{subj} \cdot K` only for balanced designs).

*Per-occasion slot* — the same formula restricted to occasion slot `occ_idx`, stored in `shrinkage_kappa_by_occ[occ_idx][kappa_idx]`. Only reported when two or more occasions are present. Useful for identifying sparse occasions (high shrinkage in one slot suggests that occasion has little information on kappa).

> **Note on unbalanced designs:** `occ_idx` is the 0-based position within each subject's own occasion list (order of first appearance in that subject's rows), *not* the raw `OCC` column value. When subjects have different `OCC` sequences (e.g., a late-entry subject whose data begins at OCC 2), a given slot may pool kappas from different occasions across subjects. In that case, use the pooled `shrinkage_kappa` and interpret per-slot values with caution.

Both metrics are `NaN` when `omega_iov` diagonal is zero or fewer than two subject-occasion observations are available for that slot.

### IWRES Autocorrelation

Two pooled autocorrelation diagnostics are reported after every fit:

**`iwres_lag1_r`** — pooled lag-1 Pearson correlation of IWRES across subjects. Values near 0 indicate no serial dependence; values approaching ±1 indicate strong autocorrelation.

**`dw_statistic`** — pooled Durbin-Watson statistic:
<div>
\[ \text{DW} = \frac{\sum_i \sum_t (e_{i,t} - e_{i,t-1})^2}{\sum_i \sum_t e_{i,t}^2} \]
</div>

| DW range | Interpretation |
|----------|---------------|
| ≈ 2.0 | No autocorrelation |
| < 1.5 | Positive autocorrelation — structural model likely missing dynamics |
| > 2.5 | Negative autocorrelation — possible over-parameterization or misspecified error model |

Subjects with fewer than 2 finite IWRES values are excluded from both statistics. Both fields are `NaN` when no subject qualifies.

When `dw_statistic < 1.5`, ferx emits a warning suggesting a transit absorption model, additional compartment, or IOV on ka/F (plus SDE process noise for ODE models). When `dw_statistic > 2.5`, the warning suggests over-parameterization or a misspecified error model.

### Covariance Status

`covariance_status: CovarianceStatus` takes one of three values:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Computed` | Covariance step succeeded; SE values are valid |
| `Failed` | Hessian was singular or inversion failed; SE fields are `None` |
| `NotRequested` | `covariance = false` was set; SE fields are `None` |

### Run Record Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `model_name` | Name from the `.ferx` file (or `"Unnamed"`) |
| `ferx_version` | Version of ferx-core that produced the result |
| `wall_time_secs` | Wall-clock time for the complete fit (seconds) |
| `gradient_method_inner` | Gradient method used in the inner (EBE) loop, e.g. `analytic (Dual2)` or `finite differences` |
| `gradient_method_outer` | Gradient method used in the outer loop, e.g. `finite differences` |
| `uses_ode_solver` | `true` if the model uses the ODE solver, `false` for analytical PK |
| `n_threads_used` | Number of Rayon threads used during estimation |
| `nlopt_missing_algorithms` | NLopt algorithms that were requested but unavailable in this build (empty when all available) |
| `covariance_n_evals_estimated` | Estimated number of OFV evaluations the covariance step will run, populated only when `run_covariance_step = true` and `n_parameters > 30` |

### EBE Convergence Diagnostics

Counters from the inner-loop (EBE) optimizer, useful for diagnosing problematic fits. Always `0` for SAEM (which uses MH sampling rather than EBE optimization).

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ebe_convergence_warnings` | Number of outer iterations in which at least one subject had an unconverged EBE |
| `max_unconverged_subjects` | Worst-case unconverged-subject count seen in a single outer iteration |
| `total_ebe_fallbacks` | Total number of times the Nelder-Mead fallback was invoked across all subjects and outer iterations |

## Timing File (`{model}-timing.txt`)

A single-line text file with the wall-clock estimation time:

```
elapsed_seconds=0.496000
```

This measures only the estimation step (not parsing or data reading).

## Optimizer Trace CSV

When `optimizer_trace = true` is set in `[fit_options]`, a CSV is written to `/tmp/ferx_trace_<pid>_<ts>.csv`. The path is also stored in `FitResult::trace_path`.

Each row is one outer iteration. See the [fit-options trace table](model-file/fit-options.md#optimizer-trace) for the full column reference.

Example use in R (with the `ferx` package):

```r
fit <- ferx_fit("model.ferx", "data.csv", optimizer_trace = TRUE)
trace <- read.csv(fit$trace_path)
plot(trace$iter, trace$ofv, type = "l", xlab = "Iteration", ylab = "OFV")
```
