# Changelog

All notable changes to **ferx-core** are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
(see the [Releases](https://ferx-nlme.github.io/ferx-core/development/sdlc.html#9-releases)
section of the SDLC for the versioning policy).

<!--
  HOW TO MAINTAIN THIS FILE
  - Add an entry under [Unreleased] in the same PR as your change, in the right
    category (Added / Changed / Deprecated / Removed / Fixed / Security /
    Performance). One bullet, user-facing language, reference the issue/PR (#NN).
  - At release time: rename [Unreleased] to the new version + date, then start a
    fresh empty [Unreleased] and update the compare links at the bottom.
  - The R wrapper (ferx-r) tracks its own user-facing changes in NEWS.md.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Time-to-event / survival modelling (Phase 1): `[event_model]` block, TTE
  datareader, likelihood, and API wiring, behind the `survival` feature
  (#191, #192).
- `[data_selection]` block with NONMEM-style `IGNORE`/`ACCEPT` record filtering,
  plus an `ExclusionSummary` on `FitResult` surfaced in the CLI and YAML output.
- Combined ferx-core + ferx-r development documentation: a Development Lifecycle
  (SDLC) page and a Contributing page in the book.

### Changed
- IMP (importance sampling) now jointly samples (η, κ) for IOV models,
  integrating over inter-occasion variability so the reported `−2 log L` is
  directly comparable to FOCE/FOCEI and NONMEM `METHOD=IMP`. Previously κ was
  held fixed at its EBE mode, giving a partial marginal; `kappa_treatment` in
  the fit YAML is now `marginalized` rather than `fixed_at_mode` (#186).

### Fixed
- IOV FOCEI marginal likelihood now matches NONMEM after the Almquist Laplace
  correction (#109, #203).
- SAEM no longer collapses a block Ω to a rank-1 (near-unit-correlation)
  solution (#191).
- Stacked `EVID=4` reset occasions are segmented onto a monotonic timeline
  (#195, #197).
- `sdtab` no longer emits stray ETA columns (regression from #185).
- `warfarin --simulate` works again, and the docs `verify-build` step is fixed
  (#199, #200).

### Performance
- Autodiff inner gradients now flow through `EVID=3/4` resets and lag time,
  removing a large finite-difference fallback slowdown (#198).
