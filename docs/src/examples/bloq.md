# BLOQ (M3 method)

This example shows how to fit a model to data that contains observations below
the assay lower limit of quantification (BLOQ) using Beal's **M3 method**.
Instead of dropping BLOQ rows — which biases terminal-phase parameter estimates
— each censored observation contributes
`P(y < LLOQ | θ, η) = Φ((LLOQ − f)/√V)` to the likelihood.

## Dataset (`data/warfarin_bloq.csv`)

This is the warfarin dataset with an added `CENS` column. Ten late-time
observations that originally fell below an assay LLOQ of 2.0 µg/mL have been
marked `CENS=1` and their `DV` cell set to the LLOQ value:

```csv
ID,TIME,DV,EVID,AMT,CMT,RATE,MDV,CENS
1,0,.,1,100,1,0,1,0
1,0.5,5.3653,0,.,1,0,0,0
...
1,96,2.5019,0,.,1,0,0,0
1,120,2,0,.,1,0,0,1
```

**NONMEM `CENS` convention**: when `CENS=1`, the row is censored and `DV`
carries the LLOQ value — not the true (unobserved) concentration. Rows with no
`CENS` column, or `CENS=0`, are treated as ordinary quantified observations.

The only two lines that differ from a plain fit are `bloq_method = m3` in
`[fit_options]` and the added `CENS` column in the CSV. Nothing else in the
model changes.

## Running

```bash

```

## Expected Results

--- Objective Function ---
OFV:  -217.1841

--- THETA Estimates ---
TVCL                 0.132811
TVV                  7.732354
TVKA                 0.811661

--- OMEGA Estimates ---
  OMEGA(1,1) = 0.029021  (CV% = 17.0)
  OMEGA(2,2) = 0.009557  (CV% = 9.8)
  OMEGA(3,3) = 0.338106  (CV% = 58.1)

--- SIGMA Estimates ---
  SIGMA(1) = 0.010761
```

These match a NONMEM 7.5.1 LAPLACE M3 reference (`tests/nonmem/warfarin_bloq.{ctl,lst}`)
to ~4 significant figures on the structural and variance parameters (TVCL 0.132801,
TVV 7.73139, TVKA 0.809824, PROP 0.010760, ω 0.028849 / 0.009544 / 0.335772). The
NONMEM objective uses the F_FLAG likelihood convention for censored rows, which
carries a different additive constant than ferx's M3 term, so the OFV is not directly
comparable (the MLE is).

The diagnostic table (`warfarin_bloq-sdtab.csv`) gains a `CENS` column, and the
`IWRES` / `CWRES` cells for censored rows are written as empty (a weighted
Gaussian residual is undefined when the observed value is censored).

## Method Notes

- **Activation requires both pieces**: the `CENS` column in the data file *and*
  `bloq_method = m3` in `[fit_options]`. Without the option, `CENS=1` rows are
  treated as ordinary observations at the LLOQ value, which biases the fit.
- **FOCE and FOCEI give different M3 optima.** `method = foce` keeps a consistent
  Sheiner–Beal objective: censored rows leave the linearized marginal and re-enter
  as `−log Φ((LLOQ − f̂)/√R⁰)` with the population (η=0) variance, matching NONMEM
  `METHOD=1 LAPLACE` *without* INTER. `method = focei` evaluates the censored term
  at the conditional variance (NONMEM with INTER). Both have exact analytic
  gradients. On warfarin BLOQ the two land at meaningfully different `TVKA`
  (FOCE ≈ 0.71, FOCEI ≈ 0.81), exactly as the corresponding NONMEM runs do — pick
  the method to match your reference fit. (Earlier versions silently promoted
  censored subjects to FOCEI under `method = foce`.)
- **Gauss-Newton caveat.** With `method = gn` or `gn_hybrid`, the BHHH
  information-matrix approximation degrades as the BLOQ fraction grows (each
  censored row carries less Fisher information than its Gaussian counterpart).
  A warning is emitted; for >20% censoring prefer `focei`.
- **SAEM** optimizes θ/σ with M3 in the M-step directly, so no special handling
  is required beyond setting `bloq_method = m3`.
