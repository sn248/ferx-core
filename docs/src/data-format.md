# Data Format

ferx-core reads data in NONMEM-compatible CSV format. This is the standard format used across population PK tools.

## Required Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `ID` | string/numeric | Subject identifier |
| `TIME` | numeric | Time relative to first dose |
| `DV` | numeric | Dependent variable (observed concentration) |

## Optional Standard Columns

| Column | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `EVID` | integer | 0 | Event ID: 0 = observation, 1 = dose, 2 = other event, 3 = system reset, 4 = reset + dose |
| `AMT` | numeric | 0 | Dose amount (only for `EVID=1` or `EVID=4`) |
| `CMT` | integer | 1 | Compartment number (1-indexed) |
| `RATE` | numeric | 0 | Infusion rate. 0 = bolus dose |
| `MDV` | integer | 0 | Missing DV flag. 1 = DV should be ignored |
| `II` | numeric | 0 | Interdose interval for repeated dosing |
| `SS` | integer | 0 | Steady-state flag. 1 = assume steady state |
| `CENS` | integer | 0 | Censoring flag. 1 = observation is below LLOQ; `DV` carries the LLOQ value. Paired with `bloq_method = m3` in `[fit_options]` to enable likelihood-based handling — see [BLOQ example](examples/bloq.md). |

## Occasion Column (IOV)

When using Inter-Occasion Variability (IOV), add an occasion-index column to the dataset and specify its name with `iov_column` in `[fit_options]`. The column:

- Contains **integer occasion indices** (e.g. 1, 2, 3…) — one per row
- Applies to both dose rows and observation rows
- Is **excluded from covariate auto-detection**

Example dataset with `OCC` column:

```csv
ID,TIME,DV,EVID,AMT,CMT,MDV,OCC
1,0,.,1,100,1,1,1
1,1,9.5,0,.,.,0,1
1,2,7.3,0,.,.,0,1
1,24,.,1,100,1,1,2
1,25,10.1,0,.,.,0,2
1,26,8.2,0,.,.,0,2
```

The occasion index can be any positive integer; they do not need to start at 1 or be consecutive, but a different number means a different occasion with its own kappa EBE.

See [IOV documentation](estimation/iov.md) for full details.

## Covariate Columns

Any column not in the standard set above is automatically treated as a covariate. Covariate values are:

- **Time-constant**: The first non-missing value for each subject is used
- **Time-varying**: If values change over time for a subject, Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) is applied per event (NONMEM-equivalent: `[individual_parameters]` is re-evaluated at each dose and observation row using that row's covariate values)

Covariate names in the data file are matched case-insensitively to names used in `[individual_parameters]` expressions.

### Time-varying covariate scope

Time-varying covariates are supported for **all** analytical structural models and ODE-defined models:

- 1-compartment IV bolus (`one_cpt_iv_bolus`)
- 1-compartment infusion (`one_cpt_infusion`)
- 1-compartment oral (`one_cpt_oral`)
- 2-compartment IV bolus (`two_cpt_iv_bolus`)
- 2-compartment infusion (`two_cpt_infusion`)
- 2-compartment oral (`two_cpt_oral`)
- 3-compartment IV bolus (`three_cpt_iv_bolus`)
- 3-compartment infusion (`three_cpt_infusion`)
- 3-compartment oral (`three_cpt_oral`)
- All ODE-defined models (via `[odes]`)

For oral models, the bolus dose into compartment 1 is interpreted as the depot (NONMEM ADVAN2/ADVAN4/ADVAN12 convention) and observation read-out reads the central compartment.

The autodiff (Enzyme) gradient fast path is also event-driven for all analytical models — TV-cov subjects keep AD-accelerated gradients *and* an AD-accelerated H-matrix Jacobian (forward-mode), so neither the inner-loop gradient nor the per-iteration Jacobian falls back to finite-differences.

Infusion routing on the event-driven path:

- **IV models**: central infusion (cmt=1) for all 1/2/3-cpt; **peripheral infusion** for 2-cpt (cmt=2) and 3-cpt (cmt=2 → periph1, cmt=3 → periph2). Steady-state amounts per channel are computed by linear superposition over the channels.
- **Oral models**: central infusion (cmt=2) is supported; peripheral infusion is rare clinically and still panics with a clear message (tracked as a follow-up).

## Event Types (EVID)

| EVID | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Observation record. `DV` is used for estimation. |
| 1 | Dosing record. `AMT` is administered to compartment `CMT`. |
| 2 | Other event (typically a covariate-change marker). The compartment state is unchanged but the rate matrix is refreshed from this row's covariate values — matching NONMEM's `$PK runs at every record` semantic. Only meaningful when at least one covariate is time-varying; for time-constant data EVID=2 rows are skipped (would be no-ops). |
| 3 | System reset. All compartment amounts are set to zero at this time, and any ongoing infusion is turned off. No dose is given and `DV` is ignored. |
| 4 | Reset and dose. Like EVID=3 (zero every compartment, stop ongoing infusions) followed immediately by a dose of `AMT` into compartment `CMT`. |

## System Resets (EVID=3 / EVID=4)

A reset record empties every compartment at its `TIME`, as if the subject's drug history started over from that point. `EVID=3` is a pure reset; `EVID=4` resets and then administers the row's dose into the freshly emptied system. This matches NONMEM's reset-event semantics and is useful for, e.g., modelling washout between treatment cycles or re-using one subject record for independent dosing episodes.

```csv
ID,TIME,DV,EVID,AMT,CMT,MDV
1,0,.,1,100,1,1
1,1,9.5,0,.,.,0
1,4,6.1,0,.,.,0
1,24,.,3,.,.,1
1,24,.,1,100,1,1
1,25,9.4,0,.,.,0
```

Notes:

- Resets force the [event-driven analytical / ODE prediction path](../estimation/foce.md) — dose superposition cannot express a mid-record reset — so any analytical or ODE model supports them with no configuration.
- Under `gradient_method = ad`, reset-bearing subjects fall back to finite-difference gradients (the autodiff propagators do not yet carry a reset event); results are unaffected, only the gradient method.
- Resets are **not** supported on the EKF/SDE path (`[diffusion]` models). A reset row on an SDE model emits a warning and is ignored.

## Example Dataset

```csv
ID,TIME,DV,EVID,AMT,CMT,RATE,MDV,WT,CRCL
1,0,.,1,100,1,0,1,70,95
1,0.5,9.49,0,.,.,.,0,70,95
1,1,14.42,0,.,.,.,0,70,95
1,2,17.56,0,.,.,.,0,70,95
1,4,15.23,0,.,.,.,0,70,95
1,8,10.15,0,.,.,.,0,70,95
2,0,.,1,150,1,0,1,85,110
2,0.5,14.2,0,.,.,.,0,85,110
2,1,21.3,0,.,.,.,0,85,110
```

Key points:
- Dose records (`EVID=1`) have `MDV=1` and `DV=.` (missing)
- Observation records (`EVID=0`) have `MDV=0` and a valid `DV`
- Covariates (`WT`, `CRCL`) are included as extra columns
- Missing values can be represented as `.` or left empty

## Infusion Doses

For IV infusions, set `RATE` to the infusion rate (amount per time unit):

```csv
ID,TIME,DV,EVID,AMT,CMT,RATE,MDV
1,0,.,1,500,1,50,1
```

This administers 500 units at a rate of 50 units/hour (duration = 10 hours).

## Steady-State Dosing

For steady-state simulations, set `SS=1` and `II` to the dosing interval:

```csv
ID,TIME,DV,EVID,AMT,CMT,SS,II,MDV
1,0,.,1,100,1,1,12,1
1,0.5,25.3,0,.,.,.,.,0
```

This assumes the subject has reached steady state with 100 units every 12 hours before the observation at TIME=0.5.

SS=1 is supported on every prediction path: analytical (1-/2-/3-cpt with
or without time-varying covariates) and ODE. SS=1 also composes with
`LAGTIME` — the lagged SS curve at time `t` equals the un-lagged curve
at `t - lagtime`. See [Steady-State Doses](model-file/steady-state.md)
for the full reference, including the data-validation warnings emitted
for malformed rows (missing `II`, overlapping infusions).

## Multiple Doses

Multiple doses are supported as separate rows:

```csv
ID,TIME,DV,EVID,AMT,CMT,MDV
1,0,.,1,100,1,1
1,0.5,9.49,0,.,.,0
1,12,.,1,100,1,1
1,12.5,15.2,0,.,.,0
1,24,.,1,100,1,1
1,24.5,18.1,0,.,.,0
```

## Column Name Case

Column names are case-insensitive. `ID`, `Id`, and `id` are all recognized. Covariate columns preserve their case as declared in the CSV header.
