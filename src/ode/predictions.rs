///   compartment with a dose lag time, or one fed by a built-in input-rate
///   function, is a typed error (the TAD-anchor and double-count subtleties are
///   deferred, as for the bolus path).
/// - `max_decisions` bounds the schedule (runaway guard); every action is run
///   through [`DoseAction::validate`] before it can reach the integrator.
///
/// The observe-then-dose order is pre-dose (the controller sees the trough at the
